Task Details
📝 Task 1: To-Do List Application
A command-line or GUI-based task management tool that allows users to:
✅ Add new tasks.
✅ View all pending tasks.
✅ Mark tasks as complete.
✅ Update or delete tasks.

This project helps develop skills in data management, file handling, and user interaction.

🔢 Task 2: Calculator
A simple Python-based calculator that can:
✔ Perform basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
✔ Prompt users to input numbers and select an operation.
✔ Display the result.

This task strengthens understanding of functions, user input handling, and conditional statements.

🔐 Task 3: Password Generator
A tool that generates strong and random passwords based on user preferences, including:
🔹 User-defined password length.
🔹 Options to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
🔹 Secure random password generation.

This project emphasizes Python’s random module and string manipulation techniques.

✊ Task 4: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
A fun interactive game where the user plays against the computer. Features include:
🎮 User input for rock, paper, or scissors.
🎮 Random computer-generated choices.
🎮 Game logic to determine the winner.
🎮 Displaying both choices and results.
🎮 (Optional) Score tracking across multiple rounds.

This project reinforces conditional statements, loops, and the random module in Python.

📇 Task 5: Contact Book
A mini-database system for storing and managing contact details. It allows users to:
📌 Add new contacts (name, phone number, email, address).
📌 View all saved contacts.
📌 Search for contacts by name or phone number.
📌 Update existing contact information.
📌 Delete contacts when needed.

This task builds skills in data storage, retrieval, and manipulation using Python.
